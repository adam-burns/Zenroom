[![Zenroom logo](https://files.dyne.org/zenroom/logos/zenroom_logotype.png)](https://dev.zenroom.org)

Zenroom is a **secure language interpreter** of both Lua and its own
secure domain specific language (DSL) to execute fast cryptographic
operations using elliptic curve arithmetics.

The Zenroom VM is very small, has **no external dependency**, is fully
deterministic and ready to run **end-to-end encryption** on any platform:
desktop, embedded, mobile, cloud and even web browsers.

**Zencode** is the name of the DSL executed by Zenroom: it is similar
to human language and can process large data structures while
operating cryptographic transformations and basic logical operations
on them.
